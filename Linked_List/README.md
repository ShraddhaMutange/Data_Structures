# Linked List – Data Structures

This directory contains a **comprehensive implementation of Linked Lists** using multiple programming languages.
The goal of this module is to strengthen understanding of **dynamic data structures** and pointer-based programming.

---

## 🔍 Linked List Variants Implemented

* **Singly Linear Linked List**
* **Singly Circular Linked List**
* **Doubly Linear Linked List**
* **Doubly Circular Linked List**

---

## 🛠 Operations Covered

* Insert (First, Last, At Position)
* Delete (First, Last, At Position)
* Display
* Count nodes

---

## 💻 Programming Languages

* **C** – Pointer-based implementation
* **C++** – Object-Oriented approach
* **Java** – Class-based implementation
